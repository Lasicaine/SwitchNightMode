# SwitchNightMode
An application that helps restore the system UI mode (Dark / Light) on older versions of Android.

For example: with this app you can restore light mode on devices like Redmi 4 (MIUI 10) without Dark / Light control system settings. To restore Light mode, simply press the "Night Mode OFF" button. Ready! Enjoy! =)
